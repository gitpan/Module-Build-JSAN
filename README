NAME
    Module::Build::JSAN - Build JavaScript modules for JSAN

SYNOPSIS
      use Module::Build::JSAN;

      my $build = Module::Build::JSAN->new(
          module_name    => 'Foo-Bar',
          license        => 'perl',
          dist_author    => 'Joe Developer <joe@foobar.com>',
          dist_abstract  => 'Say something pithy here',
          dist_version   => '0.02',
          keywords       => [qw(Foo Bar pithyness)],
          build_requires => {
              'Test.Simple' => 0.20,
          },
          requires     => {
              'JSAN'     => 0.10,
              'Baz-Quux' => 0.02,
          },
      );

      $build->create_build_script;

DESCRIPTION
    This is a developer aid for creating JSAN distributions. Please use the
    example given in the SYNOPSIS to create distributions.

    This works nearly identically to Module::Build, so please refer to its
    documentation.

DIFFERENCES
    1 META.json
        JSAN uses the JSON format instead of the YAML format, as it's legal
        Javascript and just plain easier to work with. This means that
        Module::Build::JSAN will generate META.json files instead of
        META.yml files. Do not be alarmed.

    2 ./Build deps
        This is a new action added in Module::Build::JSAN. You run this in
        order to install your dependencies when testing while developing.
        This will allow you to develop against the latest versions of the
        distributions you are building upon.
